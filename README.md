## Project Motivation
The project goal is to categorize the disaster message. In this project, I analyzed and built a machine learning pipeline to categorize the real disaster messages so that I could send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency. The final web app can input a new message and then get classification results in multiple categories.
